      Design on the Frontier interrogates the speculative future of graphic design and the education of the future graphic designer. The landscape of design is changing quickly. As the field embraces an increasingly amorphous definition of practice and an ever-expanding toolset, educators have a unique opportunity to both navigate and define this frontier space. Beyond market forces and the relative shelter of institutional bureaucracy, setting aside the present allows for further speculation on the future we want collectively, rather than a system that feels inevitable.

<h2 class="hovertown">
  The format of the conference, reader, and website articulates this forward-looking spirit. Instead of calling for papers, we call for ideas, thought experiments, and proposals. Motivated by a desire to provoke and energize, static presentations are instead replaced by highly participatory small events, and submissions are encouraged to reflect a broader range of investigation, from  workshops and discussions, to performance, film screenings, pop-up exhibitions, and design fiction. More akin to a fair than a conference, this network of satellite events, encourages an optimistic esprit de corps, and asks participants to proactively define the future of design education.

<h2 class="hovertown">
The conference will be an atomized network of small events that participants attend; more akin to a fair than a conference. The crenelation intrinsic to this format will have energy, encourage more casual social interaction, be more physically active, encourage an optimistic esprit de corps, and leave participants wanting more. This format will encourage participants to proactively define the future of design education rather than purely react to industry and technological changes.
